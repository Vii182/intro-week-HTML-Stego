    <h1>Why Stegosaurus are Ultimately the best Dinosaur</h1>
    <p> If we are going back in time to compare all the dinosaurs from the <b>Triassic, Jurassic,</b> and <b>Cretaceous</b> Periods, there is really only One Dinosaur that stands the test of time. <br> 
    Below, i will show you why the Stegosaurus (<i>Of the family Stegosauridae</i>) deserves more respect than the overly famous T-rex, and should also become your faviourite dinosaur!</p>

    <h2>We could talk all day about my personal thoughts and opinions..</h2>
    <p>but ultimately here you will find all the information you need to convince you that the Stegosaurus is simply amazing. <br>
        <b>Below i will list some brief interesting facts about stegosaurus</b></p> 
        <ul>
            <li><b>Armoured Plates:</b> Stegosaurus had an impressive row of large, bony plates along its back, which likely served for display, thermoregulation, or defenseâ€”making it look even more formidable.</li>
            <li><b>Thagomizer:</b> Its powerful spiked tail, known as a "thagomizer," was a fierce weapon, capable of defending against predators like Allosaurus.</li>
            <li><b>Massive Size:</b> Despite its peaceful, plant-eating nature, Stegosaurus could grow up to 30 feet long, making it one of the largest herbivores of its time.</li>
            <li><b>Tiny Brain, Big Body:</b> It may have had a small brain, but its body was an evolutionary marvel, perfectly adapted to thrive in the late Jurassic period.</li>

        <h2>The Life-Cycle of a Stegosaurus</h2>
        <p id="margin1">The lifecycle of a Stegosaurus was marked by significant physical changes, from a vulnerable hatchling to a massive, armored adult.<br> 
            Starting life in an egg, young Stegosaurus faced considerable threats from predators, relying on rapid growth and group protection. <br>
            As they matured, their iconic back plates and spiked tails developed, providing both defense and a means to attract mates. <br>
            Once fully grown, Stegosaurus played an essential role in the ecosystem as a large herbivore. Though their lifespan could <br>
            span several decades, their life, like many dinosaurs, was shaped by survival in a prehistoric world full of dangers.</p>

        <h3>Below is a Breakdown of the Different Life Stages:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Egg Stage:</b> Stegosaurus began life inside an egg, likely laid in a nest. These eggs were small relative to the adult's size, around the size of a grapefruit.</li>
            <li><b>Hatchling:</b> After hatching, baby Stegosaurus, known as hatchlings, would have been small, vulnerable, and needed protection from predators like Allosaurus or Ceratosaurus.</li>
            <li><b>Juvenile Stage:</b> As juveniles, they grew rapidly but still lacked the fully developed back plates and tail spikes (thagomizer) for defense. They likely stayed in groups for protection.</li>
            <li><b>Adulthood:</b> Upon reaching maturity, Stegosaurus grew to its full size, around 30 feet long. The plates and spikes became more prominent, helping with display, thermoregulation, and defense.</li>
            <li><b>Reproduction:</b> As adults, they would find mates and lay eggs, continuing the cycle. Little is known about specific mating behaviors, but the large plates could have been used in displays to attract mates.</li>
            <li><b>Old Age and Death:</b> Like most dinosaurs, Stegosaurus likely lived for several decades. Natural causes, environmental factors, or predation would eventually lead to their death, completing the life cycle.</li>
        </ol>
